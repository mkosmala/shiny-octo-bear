It is better to draw your shape slightly small so that some vegetation is outside your shape than to allow other types of vegetation, sky, buildings, or other things to be inside your shape. Use **plants** for any small plant that is not a shrub, crop, or grass. Use **far away vegetation** for vegetation that is too far away to determine its type.
