      "help": "What you see here is a composite of a year's worth of images. Each image is represented by a single pixel column that comes from the middle of the image. By lining up these pixel columns we can see whether the camera moved around. We call these camera moves **field of view shifts** and they make it harder for us to figure out vegetation changes. Sometimes a camera doesn't move at all and so there are no field of view shifts in a year. Sometimes the camera moves one or more times.\n\nHere is an example of a composite with no field of view shifts:\n\n ![no_shift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkosmala/SeasonSpotterLanding/gh-pages/helpimages/dukehw_2014_slice_small.png)\n\nHere is an example where the camera did move several times. You can see that the horizon line seems to suddenly jump to a new location.\n\n ![shifts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkosmala/SeasonSpotterLanding/gh-pages/helpimages/boundarywaters_2011_slice_small_orig.png)"
